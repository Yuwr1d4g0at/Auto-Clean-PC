# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

Auto-Clean-PC is designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines our security practices, known considerations, and how to report security issues.

## ✅ Security Features

### 🔐 Permission Model
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Scripts request only necessary permissions
- **Standard User Safe**: Core functionality works without administrator rights
- **Admin Escalation**: Only system-level operations require elevation
- **Permission Validation**: Scripts check privileges before attempting protected operations

### 🛡️ Safe File Operations
- **No Blind Deletion**: All file operations are validated and logged
- **Triple Safety Mode System**: Preview, Backup, or Delete options with user control
- **Smart Backup System**: Moves shortcuts to timestamped backup folder instead of deletion
- **Multi-Location Awareness**: Scans 4+ locations with per-location security validation
- **Locked File Handling**: Graceful handling of files in use
- **Path Validation**: Proper handling of paths with spaces and special characters
- **Error Recovery**: Operations continue even if individual files fail
- **Reversible Operations**: Backup mode allows easy restoration of processed shortcuts

### 📝 Audit Trail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations are logged with timestamps
- **File-Level Tracking**: Detailed records of what files were processed
- **Permission Logging**: Records when operations are skipped due to permissions
- **Error Logging**: Failed operations are documented for review

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 😨 Potential Risks
1. **File Deletion**: Scripts can permanently delete files (only in delete mode)
2. **Multi-Location Access**: Shortcut cleaner accesses multiple system locations
3. **Administrator Rights**: Some temp cleanup operations require elevated privileges
4. **System Modification**: Scripts modify system temp folders and shortcut locations
5. **PowerShell Execution**: Shortcut cleaner uses PowerShell COM objects with elevated error handling
6. **Backup Storage**: Backup mode creates additional files in Documents folder

### 🔍 Risk Mitigation
- **Default Safe Mode**: Shortcut cleaner defaults to backup mode, not deletion
- **Preview Mode Available**: Users can preview changes before applying them
- **Backup System**: Broken shortcuts moved to timestamped backup folder for recovery
- **Interactive Controls**: User explicitly chooses scan locations and safety mode
- **Detailed Logging**: Every action is recorded with mode tracking for audit and recovery
- **Selective Operations**: Only targets known temp/cache/shortcut locations
- **Permission Checks**: Validates rights before attempting protected operations
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: PowerShell operations wrapped in try/catch blocks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues safely even if individual files or locations fail

## 🏢 Enterprise Considerations

### 📋 Before Deployment
1. **Test in Isolated Environment**: Validate behavior in your specific setup
2. **Test All Safety Modes**: Try Preview, Backup, and Delete modes in test environment
3. **Review Multi-Location Access**: Understand which locations will be scanned
4. **Review Log Outputs**: Understand what files will be affected
5. **Backup Critical Data**: Ensure important files are backed up
6. **User Training**: Educate users on safety modes and location choices
7. **Test Backup Recovery**: Verify shortcuts can be restored from backup folder

### 🔧 Recommended Settings
- **Default to Preview Mode**: Train users to preview before making changes
- **Recommend Backup Mode**: Use safe backup mode for regular operations
- **Restrict Delete Mode**: Limit permanent delete mode to advanced users only
- **Run as Standard User**: For day-to-day shortcut maintenance
- **Scheduled Admin Runs**: Weekly system-level temp cleanup with admin rights
- **Monitor Logs**: Regular review of operation logs and backup folder contents
- **Backup Folder Management**: Periodic cleanup of old backup files
- **Group Policy**: Consider restricting delete mode to authorized users only

## 🐛 Reporting Security Issues

### 📧 How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. **Email** the maintainer directly (if contact info available)
3. **Include** detailed information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### 📅 Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available

## 🔄 Security Updates

### 📢 Notification Process
Security updates will be communicated through:
- GitHub repository releases
- Updated documentation
- Version changelog

### 🚀 Update Recommendations
- **Monitor Releases**: Watch the repository for updates
- **Test Updates**: Validate new versions before deployment
- **Backup Before Update**: Always backup before applying changes

## ✅ Security Best Practices

### 👤 For Users
- **Start with Preview Mode**: Always use preview mode first to see what would be changed
- **Choose Safe Backup Mode**: Use backup mode instead of permanent delete for safety
- **Review Scan Locations**: Understand which locations you're scanning before starting
- **Check Backup Folder**: Know where your backup shortcuts are stored for recovery
- **Review Scripts**: Understand what each script does before running
- **Check Logs**: Always review log files after operations
- **Test Restoration**: Practice restoring shortcuts from backup folder
- **Use Standard Account**: Run with standard user permissions when possible
- **Verify Source**: Only download scripts from trusted sources

### 🏢 For Organizations
- **Code Review**: Review script contents before deployment
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs for monitoring
- **Access Control**: Limit who can run admin-level operations
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic review of cleanup operations
- **Incident Response**: Plan for handling unexpected file deletions

## 📋 Compliance Notes

### 🔒 Data Protection
- **No Personal Data Collection**: Scripts don't collect or transmit personal information
- **Local Operation Only**: All operations are performed locally
- **Log Privacy**: Logs contain file paths but no file contents

### 📊 Audit Requirements
- **Operation Logs**: Detailed logs suitable for compliance auditing
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: All operations timestamped for audit trails
- **File Tracking**: Complete record of files processed
