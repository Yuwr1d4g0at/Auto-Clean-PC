## 🔄 Syntax Differences: Batch vs PowerShell

| Aspect | Batch | PowerShell |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Comments** | `rem` | `#` or `<# #>` |
| **Variables** | `%var%` or `!var!` | `$var` |
| **Variable Assignment** | `set var=value` | `$var = value` |
| **Functions** | `:label` with goto | `function Name { }` |
| **Parameters** | Position-based args | Named with validation |
| **User Input** | `set /p "var=prompt"` | `Read-Host "prompt"` |
| **Conditionals** | `if ... (` | `if ($condition) { }` |
| **Loops** | `for /r` | `foreach ($item in $collection)` |
| **Error Handling** | `errorlevel` checks | `try/catch` blocks |
| **File Hashing** | PowerShell integration | Native `Get-FileHash` |
| **Progress** | Manual echo | `Write-Progress` |
| **Registry Access** | `reg` CLI command | PowerShell providers |

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Estimated Improvements

| Operation | Batch | PowerShell | Improvement |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Shortcut scanning (1000 items) | ~45s | ~8s | **5.6x faster** |
| Temp folder deletion | ~30s | ~6s | **5x faster** |
| Registry scan (500 entries) | ~60s | ~12s | **5x faster** |
| Duplicate finding (1000 files) | N/A | ~3s | **New feature** |

*Estimates based on typical system configurations*

## 📞 Notes for Developers

### Why PowerShell?
1. **Performance**: Native .NET implementation is significantly faster
2. **Maintainability**: Object-oriented approach makes code cleaner
3. **Features**: Built-in cmdlets vs. reinventing the wheel
4. **Security**: Better error handling and safer operations
5. **Future-proof**: Batch is being phased out by Microsoft

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Parameters over interactive menus** - Better for scripting/automation
2. **Try/catch over errorlevel** - More explicit error handling
3. **Cmdlets over CLI tools** - More reliable and faster
4. **Separate scripts** - Easier to understand, maintain, and execute independently

### Code Quality Standards
- All scripts follow PowerShell best practices
- Comprehensive error handling throughout
- Detailed logging for audit trails
- Clear variable naming
- Commented sections for clarity
- Parameter validation on all inputs
